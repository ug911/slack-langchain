# Slackbot that uses langchain under the hood

# Local development:

1. Create your Slackbot first, by following this tutorial:
   https://slack.dev/bolt-python/tutorial/getting-started
   (We really need to create a bot template, and will do that in the future)

2. Then, copy .env.example to .env and fill in the values.

3.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

#
# To run it locally (no need to use ngrok or anything)
./run_local.sh

```
